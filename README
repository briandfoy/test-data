You can install this using in the usual Perl fashion

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
The documentation is in the module file.  You can read the 
documentation with perldoc (in the same way before or after
you install it).

	perldoc Test::Data
	
Before you install the module, you can look at the documentation
directly from the module files.

	perldoc lib/Test/Data.pm
