$Exporter::Verbose = 0;

sub import 
	{
    my $self   = shift;
    my $caller = caller;

	foreach my $package ( @_ )
		{
		my $full_package = "Test::Data::$package";
		eval{ eval "require $full_package" };
		if( $@ )
			{
			carp "Could not require Test::Data::$package: $@";
			}

		$full_package->export($caller);
		}

	}

sub VERSION { return $VERSION }

=head2 Functions

Plug-in modules define functions for each data type.  See the
appropriate module.

=head2 How it works

The Test::Data module simply emports functions from Test::Data::*
modules.  Each module defines a self-contained function, and puts
that function name into @EXPORT.  Test::Data defines its own 
import function, but that does not matter to the plug-in modules.

If you want to write a plug-in module, follow the example of one
that already exists.   Name the module Test::Data::Foo, where you
replace Foo with the right name.  Test::Data should automatically
find it.

=head1 BUGS

I'm not a very good Windows Perler, so some things don't work as
they should on Windows. I recently got a Windows box so I can
test things, but if you run into problems, I can use all the 
patches or advice you care to send.
