	* added four functions to Test::Data::Array to check if an array 
	is sorted (up or down, string or number)

0.94 - Mon Dec  1 20:57:11 CST 2003
	* No changes.  Tests should run on Windows now.

0.93 - Sat Nov 29 19:18:34 CST 2003
	* Added new META.yml
	* pod.t uses new Test::Pod technology.
	* Removed TODO test on undef_ok() catching an empty list passed
	  in.  The prototype means that C<()> will get passed as a scalar,
	  not an empty list.

	* Fixed hash_value_false_ok(), which was never defined.

0.91 - Fri Dec 20 16:48:58 2002
	* functions from Scalar::Util need full package specification
	since i do not import them.  this fixes all of the functions
	based on Scalar::Util.

	* removed dualvar test.  it does not work, and i need to figure
	out how to make it work

	* cleaned up the Pod which had some extra whitespace in places
