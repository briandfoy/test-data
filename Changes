1.240_02 2016-11-16T00:45:07Z
	* Let's try harder to see why Dan Collins's testers setup 
	doesn't like this distro.

1.240_02 2016-11-15T14:44:43Z
	* List all the prereqs, even the core ones. This is in anticipation

	* bumped the version past 1.01

0.96 - 2004-04-22
	* functions in Test::Data::Scalar now return the result of ok()
	rather than something else.  Thanks to Andy Lester for spotting
	the problem

0.95 - 2004-02-28
	* added four functions to Test::Data::Array to check if an array
	is sorted (up or down, string or number)

0.94 - 2003-12-01

	* Added new META.yml
	* pod.t uses new Test::Pod technology.
	* Removed TODO test on undef_ok() catching an empty list passed
	  in.  The prototype means that C<()> will get passed as a scalar,
	  not an empty list.

	* Fixed hash_value_false_ok(), which was never defined.

	* Fixed incorrect $VERSION in each package.

0.91 - 2002-12-20
	* functions from Scalar::Util need full package specification
	since i do not import them.  this fixes all of the functions
	based on Scalar::Util.

	out how to make it work

	* cleaned up the Pod which had some extra whitespace in places

	* fixed some calls to ok() that were missing name parameter
	* man pages install correctly

0.8 - 2002-10-23
	* all functions can take optional name arguments
	* added not_exists_ok, hash_value_undef_ok, hash_value_false_ok
